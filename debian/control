Description: Bash Script to automate SnapRAID with email notifications
 Automate the running of snapraid. Contains everything one
 needs to fully automate the sync and scrub process of SnapRAID.
 Runs sync to update the array for changes, then runs scrub 
 to check the array for silent corruption.
 The number of deletions/moved/updated is monitored and if the number exceeds
 a user defined threshold, then the sync is stopped and the user is notified.
 Can also be set to run either sync only or scrub only if one
 wants to seperate the sync and scrub operations. 
 If at any point, errors are encountered, then the user
 is notified via email.
 Mutt is used for sending emails.
 Customizable through the use of hooks - see the SnapRAID-DAILY-Hooks
 package to integrate additional notifications to services like Telegram
 or ntfy, along with the ability to stop/start services if required.
