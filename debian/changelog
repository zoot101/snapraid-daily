snapraid-daily (1.3.8-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Deletion and Moved thresholds can now be disabled permanently by
    setting them to zero in the config file.

  * This gives the option of running the script and getting it to sync
    regardless of deletions or moves each time without using the "-o"
    option.

  * More strict check on number value config parameters in config file.
    The script will now exit if they are input as something other than
    a number.

  * Removed unused logfiles since the switch to inspecting the "-l"
    logging output of SnapRAID.

  * Minor documentation improvements.

snapraid-daily (1.3.7-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Major improvments to "greeting" printouts. SnapRAID version is now
    included among other additions.

  * Code cleanup which should make planned future additions easier.

  * Added a config file option "sync_pre_hash", that one can use to disable
    SnapRAID's additional preliminary hashing step during sync.

  * Removed additional warning from end when emails are disabled since it's
    displayed at the start anyway in this case.

  * Attached scrub command logfile to emails where scrub is called on
    an unsynced array.

snapraid-daily (1.3.6-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Changed touch error check to look for multiple fatal messages instead
    to fix an issue where if one is running with the below recommended
    number of disks, the warning for this causes the script to exit
    after touch is ran.

 -- Mark Finnan <mfinnan101@gmail.com>  Wed, 28 May 2025 19:57:59 +0100

snapraid-daily (1.3.5-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Changed check on initial status to consider the status command
    logfile from the -l option to snapraid instead of the standard output.
    This simplifies getting the necessary parameters from the inital
    status check.

  * The Error check now looks at the "summary:has_bad" line. Not 100%
    sure about this just yet, the old method may be better, but it is
    very easy to revert if issues arise. Have not been able to find
    any thus far though.

  * Command logfile for snapraid status is now attached to any emails
    sent as a result of errors found in the initial status check.

  * Simplified the check for the number of files requiring touch to
    also consider the status command log file.

  * Thresholds are now printed out regardless if being overriden or not.

  * Also modified touch error check to look at the touch command logfile
    from the -l option to snapraid and check for fatal messages.

  * Added some additional systemd timer examples in the docs.

  * Added dependency on gawk for awk.

 -- Mark Finnan <mfinnan101@gmail.com>  Wed, 28 May 2025 15:17:49 +0100

snapraid-daily (1.3.4-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Added a check if there was nothing found to sync AND scrub - this
    will now be reflected in the email subject.

  * Switched to using snapraid's built-in -qqqq option instead of 
    re-directing all output to /dev/null for -q, --quiet input argument.

  * Fixed spelling of "COPYRIGHT" in man script!

  * Added an error function to handle error messages that exit immediately.

  * Added additional information in the form of an extra readme in each
    of the docs folder. These are targetting Github, but are still included
    in the /usr/share/doc/snapraid-daily/ directory for the debian
    package installations.

 -- Mark Finnan <mfinnan101@gmail.com>  Tue, 27 May 2025 23:57:49 +0100

snapraid-daily (1.3.3-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Tidied up comments to bring line count down by +200!

  * Removed a redundant check of /tmp being writable or not.

  * Changed the analysis of snapraid diff to determine array changes to
    the log from the output of the -l option instead of the standard output.
    This allows a much simplier method of a simple grep and awk as
    opposed to the more complex grep, sed then cut approach.

  * Removed check for cut and updated man pages.

  * Moved analysis of the number added/moved/copied etc. into the diff
    command function and re-used it directly for sync and scrub operations.

  * Simplified check for changes to just look at diff command exit status
    as reported by the -l log file. This is much simplier as it is just
    either "diff" or "equal".

  * Refined Email Subjects on Successful Runs to Sync OK, Scrub OK or
    all OK. All are now prefixed with "SnapRAID DAILY".

  * Added an additional check for both the moved and deletion threshold
    being exceeded at the same time to make the email output and subject
    more specific.

  * Added number of equal files found to printouts where the array is
    checked for changes by "snapraid diff".

  * Minor other improvements to code and printouts.

 -- Mark Finnan <mfinnan101@gmail.com>  Tue, 27 May 2025 11:24:51 +0100

snapraid-daily (1.3.2-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Refined new check for errors on sync and scrub commands to directly
    consider the exit status and the number of io/data/file errors
    reported by snapraid.

  * Script should now handle unexpected events or interruptions to sync
    and scrub commands more gracefully.

  * New method re-gained ability to determine if the sync command is ran
    and doesn't find anything to sync. Although as before the check with
    snapraid diff will prevent sync being ran if there are no changes.

  * Added a printout of the error counts in the email along with the
    exit status.

 -- Mark Finnan <mfinnan101@gmail.com>  Mon, 26 May 2025 20:20:31 +0100

snapraid-daily (1.3.1-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Using the "-h" option means that it is no longer good enough to
    just look for "Everything OK" in the output of the sync operation.

  * Switched to looking at the summary messages within the sync output
    log instead. The script will now report if there are File Errors,
    I/O Errors or Data Errors to give a better more descriptive output.

  * This unfortunately looses the ability to specifically detect if the
    sync command runs and finds nothing to sync, but by default the
    check for changes should ensure that sync is not called if there
    are no changes, so this probably doesn't matter.

  * Added similar checking of the scrub command log for scrub operations,
    the same granularity should now be reported if the scrub operation
    does not run successfully.

 -- Mark Finnan <mfinnan101@gmail.com>  Mon, 26 May 2025 14:40:10 +0100

snapraid-daily (1.3.0-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Added support for --force-zero, --force-empty, and --force-uuid
    options for SnapRAID. These can only be enabled through options
    in the config file (snapraid-daily.conf), and are all off by
    default.

  * Added ability to disable emails on success through an option in
    the config file. Not used by default.

  * Added "-h" option to snapraid sync to serve as another safeguard
    against errors.

  * Updated man pages and default config file.

 -- Mark Finnan <mfinnan101@gmail.com>  Mon, 26 May 2025 11:57:23 +0100

snapraid-daily (1.2.7-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Specified all return codes up at the top instead.

  * Fixed a minor issue whereby if nothing was found to scrub and the
    scrub only argument (-c, --scrub-only) was being used, the email
    subject was not changed to reflect this.

 -- Mark Finnan <mfinnan101@gmail.com>  Sun, 25 May 2025 16:22:17 +0100

snapraid-daily (1.2.6-5) stable; urgency=medium

 -- Mark Finnan <mfinnan101@gmail.com>  Tue, 20 May 2025 10:40:09 +0100

snapraid-daily (1.2.2-1) stable; urgency=medium

    Simplified syntax of checks for error strings in the status logfile.

  * Added some examples for running the script via cron.

snapraid-daily (1.2.1-2) stable; urgency=medium

  * Previously, detail was omitted in the manpage about the array being
    checked that it is up-to-date before a scrub is carried out, this has
    been included and is explicity mentioned in the main manpage now.

 -- Mark Finnan <mfinnan101@gmail.com>  Mon, 14 Apr 2025 17:04:19 +0100

    dependencies.

  * Added further examples for systemd drop-in files in the docs directory:
    /usr/share/doc/snapraid-daily/systemd-drop-ins/

 -- Mark Finnan <mfinnan101@gmail.com>  Mon, 17 Feb 2025 16:21:33 +0100

snapraid-daily (1.2.0-1) stable; urgency=medium

    locations.

  * Updated manpage to mention the above and also the check for the lockfile
    added in version 1.1.0

  * Other refinements to man pages to make explanations more clear.

  * Changed check for the snapraid-content file being writable, because
    previously it would fail if the file path had spaces in its name.

  * This has been fixed and changed to a method using sed only, previously
    xargs was used.

 -- Mark Finnan <mfinnan101@gmail.com>  Mon, 10 Feb 2025 10:00:57 +0100

snapraid-daily (1.1.1-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Added ".txt" to the end of the logfile names so they don't cause
    problems for any systems downloading them from email logs.

 -- Mark Finnan <mfinnan101@gmail.com>  Sun, 05 Jan 2025 11:19:03 +0100

snapraid-daily (1.0.9-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Switched to using mktemp to create logfiles.

  * Changed postinst script to output a message on clean installs.

  * Bundled an elementary config file into the default location, so
    the script should run out of the box with default settings.

  * Syntax improvements in manpages.

 -- Mark Finnan <mfinnan101@gmail.com>  Wed, 14 Nov 2024 10:15:19 +0100

snapraid-daily (1.0.8-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Changed to a while loop in the parse_arguments function, as found
    this to be a more reliable way of looping through the arguments than
    the for loop that was previously being used.

  * Added the ability to override the default config by the usage of
    an argument to the script. (-f or --config) This is mainly intended for
    the case where one might have multiple snapraid arrays on the same
    system.

  * Streamlined the picking of the config file using an if-elif-else statement,
    instead of the messy nested if that was used previously.

  * Also changed the order of preference to look for the config file to
    the below. Previously the sample config file in the docs folder was
    looked for directly after the default location.
    1: Custom Config supplied via -f or --config
    2: /etc/snapraid-daily.conf
    3: Same Directory as script
    4: /usr/share/doc/snapraid-daily/sample-config/snapraid-daily.conf

  * Minor improvements to output messages to make them more readable.

  * Added sample systemd drop-in files and some notes about using them in
    the docs directory.

  * Updated the manual pages to reflect the ability to specify a custom
    config file, and mention the included systemd drop-in files.

snapraid-daily (1.0.7-2) stable; urgency=medium

  * Corrected prerm maintainer script exit status to 0 instead of 1!

 -- Mark Finnan <mfinnan101@gmail.com>  Tue, 05 Nov 2024 20:07:17 +0100

snapraid-daily (1.0.7-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Corrected prerm maintainer script to also interpret "activating" as
    a valid output to systemctl is-active to correctly stop a service 
    if it is currently running upon running apt purge or apt remove.

 -- Mark Finnan <mfinnan101@gmail.com>  Mon, 04 Nov 2024 20:01:07 +0100

snapraid-daily (1.0.6-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Added template systemd timer and service files into the package,
    to be installed to /etc/systemd/system but these are not enabled
    by default.

  * Updated manpages and documentation to reflect this and encourage
    the user to use overrides through systemctl edit.

  * Added a postinst script to detect a 1st time installation and
    reload systemd (may prompt the user for a user and group name to
    run snapraid-daily here on future releases)

  * Added a prerm script to check if the timers/services are either
    active or enabled and stop/disable them accordingly followed by
    a reload of systemd.

snapraid-daily (1.0.5-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Script would exit if mutt was not installed. Changed functionality
    to run to the end but disable emails if mutt is not installed.
    This is the expected behaviour as mutt is recommended instead
    of a standard dependency.

  * Removed version and date from manual pages so changing them is no
    longer necessary for new revisions.

 -- Mark Finnan <mfinnan101@gmail.com>  Wed, 16 Oct 2024 11:32:51 +0100

snapraid-daily (1.0.4-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Removed ability to force sync after a certain number of times where
    the script would exit after the thresholds were found to have been
    exceeded.
  * Created man pages - snapraid-daily(1) and snapraid-daily.conf(1)
  
  * Added dependencies to debian package.
  
  * Changed the script to run in the complete absense of the config file
    and assume a range of defaults that should be good enough for the
    vast majority of users.

  * Note that the emails are disabled in this case.

  * Added a -h, --help argument to print out a quick help message.

 -- Mark Finnan <mfinnan101@gmail.com>  Sun, 06 Oct 2024 15:17:06 +0100

    for sync, scrub and override thresholds respectively as shorter
    versions of the previous accepted arguments.
 
 -- Mark Finnan <mfinnan101@gmail.com>  Sat, 22 Jul 2023 06:39:24 +0100

snapraid-daily (0.9.1-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed an issue where the script would not continue after detecting the
    right amount of tries in the file that records the number of failed
    syncs due to the thresholds being exceed in certain conditions.

  * Reduced deletion of log files to 30 days old.
 
 -- Mark Finnan <mfinnan101@gmail.com>  Sun, 22 Jan 2023 19:47:43 +0100

snapraid-daily (0.9.0-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Added the ability to set a number of tries before forcing a sync in the
    config file. This way a sync will be forced after the thresholds have
    been found to be exceeded after a certain number of times.

  * This removes the need of the user to have to interact with the system
    in this case. However this does assume the files deleted/moved are
    not important.

  * Re-structred parts of the script to operate out of its own directory,
    for example /opt/snapraid-daily/.

  * Added systemd unit files a .timer file and a .service file for a
    standalone sync job, a standalone scrub job or a combined default
    of sync, then scrub.

 -- Mark Finnan <mfinnan101@gmail.com>  Sat, 07 Jan 2023 12:37:43 +0100

snapraid-daily (0.8.4-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Added a check on the number of moved files in addition to the deleted
    files since the last sync.

snapraid-daily (0.8.1-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Added a check for --scrub-only and --sync-only being specified at the
    same time - the script will now exit if this is done.

  * Added a warning printout if one specifies --override-thresholds while
    --scrub-only is active to mention the former has no effect in this
    case.

  * Fixed a problem in the if-elif-else statement in the function that
    determines the arguments.

 -- Mark Finnan <mfinnan101@gmail.com>  Sun, 09 Oct 2022 17:11:34 +0100

snapraid-daily (0.8.0-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Combined snapraid-sync and snapraid-scrub scripts into one master
    script.

  * By default the script will now do a check on the initial status
    via "snapraid status", then move on to running touch if required.

  * After that the script will run sync, finally followed by scrub.
  
  * Added the ability to pass arguments to the script: --scrub-only,
    --sync-only and --override-thresholds.

  * This allows one to run sync only or run scrub only which is useful
    if somebody wants to seperate the sync and scrub operations.

  * The script will now attach the command log if an error was detected.
  
  * This allows the user to know the issue by just looking at the
    notification emails alone.

  * Changed subject of notification email to "SnapRAID-Scrub" or 
    "SnapRAID-Sync" from "SnapRAID-Daily" if sync-only or
    scrub-only arguments are being used.

snapraid-daily (0.7.0-1) stable; urgency=medium
