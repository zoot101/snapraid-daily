snapraid-daily (1.5.3-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Added a check for an update from the Github page. Now when the
    script is called, it will do a check to see if curl is installed
    and if so, it will check the Github page for a newer version
    and notify the user by way of printing a notice and also adding
    a line to the email log.

  * Also added a "disable_update_check" parameter to the config file
    to disable the update check functionality if desired.

  * Updated default config file and example that incorporates multiple
    hooks.

  * Removed duplicate systemd example files from systemd-examples docs
    directory.
    - Improved examples in sample systemd timer file.

  * Added section to unset all config file variables before the config
    file is read, and also all variables set by arguments to the script.
    This prevents issues in the unlikely event those exact variables are
    set via export commands externally before calling then script.

  * Made config file error detection more robust. The script will now
    exit if syntax errors are present in the config file.

  * Improved Cron Documentation.

  * Added recommended package dependency on curl.

  * Minor Code Cleanup
    - Silence which commands, reduce linecount, trim comments.

snapraid-daily (1.5.2-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Added ability to specify a different path to the SnapRAID binary
    for cases where SnapRAID may have been installed in a non-standard
    location through the use of an option in the main config
    file - Closes [#4].

  * Updated default config file to add the above option. Note that no
    modification to the config file is required for existing users. The
    script will correctly default to using the output of the which snapraid
    if no custom SnapRAID binary path is specified in the config file.

  * Updated the config file manual entry - snapraid-daily.conf(1), and
    the main manual entry - snapraid-daily(1).

  * Updated example config file to add the new option and also show a
    sample of using the snapraid-daily-commands hook script in the
    SnapRAID-DAILY-Hooks repository.

snapraid-daily (1.5.1-2) stable; urgency=medium

  * Made the postinst maintainer script more gracefully handle
    the very unlikely event of an upgrade from a version < 1.5.0
    where the config file doesn't exist.

snapraid-daily (1.5.1-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed Minor Issue where printouts were incorrectly counting
    the number of hook scripts called at the end. Closes [#3].

  * Debian Package Related Updates:

    - Configured debian/rules to call dh_installsystemd with the
      options not to start or enable the systemd service and
      timer files upon installation, and also not to stop or
      restart them upon upgrades. Timer files need to manually
      started. This is of course intended as the config file
      has to be configured anyway.

    - Switched to using debhelper tokens in postinst and
      prerm maintainer scripts.

    - Deleted postrm script as its no longer required.

    - Refined check on hook naming in the config file in the
      postinst script so that the config file hook script
      naming (start_hook -> start_hook1) is only updated if upgrading
      from a version < 1.5.0.

    - Also implemented the above check on removing old unmodified
      systemd unit files from /etc/systemd/system.

    - Changed debian/copyright to cover all files to clear up
      lintian warning on source package.

    - Modified debian/rules with comments to clear up some lintian
      warnings.

    - Added debian/po/POTFILES.in and modified templates to enable
      translations. Unlikely that this will be translated, but good
      to have!

    - Also added a build dependency on po-debconf.

    - Refined prompt messages.

    - Package is now completely Lintian clean and thus fully in line
      with Debian standards!

snapraid-daily (1.5.0-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Added support for multiple hooks! The script can now call up to 5
    start, end and notification hooks. This greatly expands the ability
    for customisation. Closes [#2].

  * Renamed hook script variables to add numbers to enable this change:
    - start_hook to start_hook1
    - end_hook to end_hook1
    - notification_hook to notification_hook1
    If installed via the package, the debian/postinst script will make an
    edit to the config file to update the naming, such that the upgrade
    should be seamless. If not installed via the package, one will have to
    manually change the hook naming in the config file.

  * Note however the update of the config file will only work on the default
    config file location - /etc/snapraid-daily.conf. If one is using a 
    config file in another location, updating the config file manually is
    required.
    - See the updated documentation on the hooks.

  * The User is now prompted to enter a user name and group upon installing
    the debian package. This is to automate running the service as a user
    other than root if desired.

  * Script result is now printed as "Warning" if errors are encountered
    while running the end hook(s). However the script will still run to the
    end as before.

  * Updates to Manual Entries: snapraid-daily(1) and snapraid-daily.conf(1)

  * Fixed issue where the notification hooks were not called if the script
    ended in a Warning condition with the disable_emails_on_success parameter
    enabled.

  * Systemd unit files are now installed in /usr/lib/systemd/system as is
    now the case with Debian, updated postinst script to handle this.
    - On older versions, if installed via the package the unit files were
      installed in /etc/systemd/system. If they still exist there without
      modification, the postinst script will move them to the new location,
      otherwise they are left unchanged.
    - Does not effect manual installations.

  * Debian Package updates:
    - Fixed dpkg-source warnings while building the package. Package is no
      longer regarded as a native debian package.
    - Updated debian/control dependencies, snapraid-daily-hooks (>=0.3.3)
      is now suggested instead for full compatibility.
    - Removed unused dependency for findutils. It was originally included
      for xargs which is no longer used.
    - Added a Pre-Depends dependency for debconf to implement the prompts
      during installation.
    - Updated debian/postinst script to implement the prompts for a user
      and group, and also to handle checking the config file for new
      hook naming syntax.
    - Added a postrm script to purge debconf and also remove config files
      not already removed through the purge operation.
    - Removed printouts from prerm script.
    - Moved sample config to examples folder to fix .conf extension having
      it converted to a different format on package based installs.
    - Removed build dependency on dh-exec.
    - Lintian check completed on package.

  * The pace of updates should now slow down, as most features that were
    planned to be added have now been added.
    - Feel free to raise an issue on Github if you have any suggestions!

snapraid-daily (1.4.3-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * In the unlikely case for the default run of a sync followed by a 
    scrub, the script would report everything is okay if changes in
    the array were still found directly after the sync operation. Now
    the script will exit with an error and report this to the user. 

  * Moved default systemd unit files to /lib/systemd/system from 
    /etc/systemd/system

  * The debian/postinst script has been updated to check for service and
    timer files in /etc/systemd/system and handle the change in location.
    - If user modification of those files is found, the old files are
      left behind untouched.
    - If on the other hand, user modification is not found, the old files
      are deleted in favor of the new location.
    - This should be seemless as by default precedence is given to
      /etc/systemd/system by systemd.

  * Update manpage to mention the new default location for the service
    unit files, add details about the default run times for the 
    bundled timer files, and how to adjust them as this was previously
    not discussed.

  * Update description in debian/control.

    hook is called.

  * Code cleanup - remove outdated comments.

  * Script tested on Fedora 42, tweaks to the check for the 1st content
    file to get it to run smoother.

  * Main manpage improvements, and additional details added about the
    hooks.

  * Removed unused status logfile generation and updated default
    config file comments.

  * Minor improvements to error printout messages.

  * Added a Suggests for snapraid-daily-hooks in debian/control.

snapraid-daily (1.4.0-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Added the ability to use custom start and end hooks. The primary
    intention of these is that the user could stop and restart
    services at the start and end of the main script to allow SnapRAID
    to run without the risk of files being modfied while in use, but
    they could be used for anything else as desired.

  * Start/Stop Hooks are passed a "start" and "end" argument like so:
     - /path/to/start/hook start
     - /path/to/end/hook end
    Using the "start" and "end" arguments allows the same hook script
    to be used for both operations. It is also possible to use only
    the start hook or end hook, using both simulataneously is not
    required.

  * Added the ability to use a custom notification hook. This allows
    the user to use an alternative form of notification to standard
    emails if desired. 
    The notification hook is called like so:
     -  /path/to/hook "Email-Subject" "Email-Body" "Email-Attachment"
    (The attachments are only present in the case of an error)

  * Added an Updated Threshold in addition to the Moved and Deletion
    thresholds already present.

  * disable_emails_on_success parameter will also disable the calls to
    the custom notification hook upon completing a successful run.

  * Diff command logfile is now attached to the emails when sending
    a notification email about exceeded thresholds or when scrub only
    is selected and the array has changes. This allows the user to
    directly see what files have changed from the email.
    
  * Updated man pages to add details about start, end and notification
    hooks.

  * Updated default config file to add hook parameters and comments
    providing detailed explanations.

  * Added an example hook script for the start/end functions to the
    docs directory.

  * Specified the modified mutt_oauth2 python script in the examples
    in the debian package directory so ".py" is not interpreted as a
    language.

  * Improvements to "Greeting" included at the start of the email
    showing the input options.

  * Note that on Debian 12 "Bookworm" or 13 "Trixie"  packaged
    versions of SnapRAID, the version is reported as "none" instead
    of "12.2" or "12.4". This is caused by the SnapRAID compliation
    options used in the Debian packaged version and not due to the
    script itself.

  * Added a signature of the system hostname to the emails.

  * Made detection of content file from snapraid.conf more robust so
    spaces or tabs at the end or start of the line or quotes dont 
    cause issues. 

  * Minor code cleanup - Removed the use of cat and some awk calls.

snapraid-daily (1.3.9-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed an issue that if the script was falling back to using a config
    file in the same directory as the script it would fail to find
    it if called via a symbolic link.

  * Added folder in the docs for some experimentation with snapraid.

snapraid-daily (1.3.8-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Deletion and Moved thresholds can now be disabled permanently by
    setting them to zero in the config file.

  * This gives the option of running the script and getting it to sync
    regardless of deletions or moves each time without using the "-o"
    option.

  * More strict check on number value config parameters in config file.
    The script will now exit if they are input as something other than
    a number.

  * Removed unused logfiles since the switch to inspecting the "-l"
    logging output of SnapRAID.

  * Minor documentation improvements.

snapraid-daily (1.3.7-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Major improvments to "greeting" printouts. SnapRAID version is now
    included among other additions.

  * Code cleanup which should make planned future additions easier.

  * Added a config file option "sync_pre_hash", that one can use to disable
    SnapRAID's additional preliminary hashing step during sync.

  * Removed additional warning from end when emails are disabled since it's
    displayed at the start anyway in this case.

  * Attached scrub command logfile to emails where scrub is called on
    an unsynced array.

snapraid-daily (1.3.6-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Changed touch error check to look for multiple fatal messages instead
    to fix an issue where if one is running with the below recommended
    number of disks, the warning for this causes the script to exit
    after touch is ran.

 -- Mark Finnan <mfinnan101@gmail.com>  Wed, 28 May 2025 19:57:59 +0100

snapraid-daily (1.3.5-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Changed check on initial status to consider the status command
    logfile from the -l option to snapraid instead of the standard output.
    This simplifies getting the necessary parameters from the inital
    status check.

  * The Error check now looks at the "summary:has_bad" line. Not 100%
    sure about this just yet, the old method may be better, but it is
    very easy to revert if issues arise. Have not been able to find
    any thus far though.

  * Command logfile for snapraid status is now attached to any emails
    sent as a result of errors found in the initial status check.

  * Simplified the check for the number of files requiring touch to
    also consider the status command log file.

  * Thresholds are now printed out regardless if being overriden or not.

  * Also modified touch error check to look at the touch command logfile
    from the -l option to snapraid and check for fatal messages.

  * Added some additional systemd timer examples in the docs.

  * Added dependency on gawk for awk.

snapraid-daily (1.3.4-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Added a check if there was nothing found to sync AND scrub - this
    will now be reflected in the email subject.

  * Switched to using snapraid's built-in -qqqq option instead of 
    re-directing all output to /dev/null for -q, --quiet input argument.

  * Fixed spelling of "COPYRIGHT" in man script!

  * Added an error function to handle error messages that exit immediately.

  * Added additional information in the form of an extra readme in each
    of the docs folder. These are targetting Github, but are still included
    in the /usr/share/doc/snapraid-daily/ directory for the debian
    package installations.

snapraid-daily (1.3.3-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Tidied up comments to bring line count down by +200!

  * Removed a redundant check of /tmp being writable or not.

  * Changed the analysis of snapraid diff to determine array changes to
    the log from the output of the -l option instead of the standard output.
    This allows a much simplier method of a simple grep and awk as
    opposed to the more complex grep, sed then cut approach.

  * Removed check for cut and updated man pages.

  * Moved analysis of the number added/moved/copied etc. into the diff
    command function and re-used it directly for sync and scrub operations.

  * Simplified check for changes to just look at diff command exit status
    as reported by the -l log file. This is much simplier as it is just
    either "diff" or "equal".

  * Refined Email Subjects on Successful Runs to Sync OK, Scrub OK or
    all OK. All are now prefixed with "SnapRAID DAILY".

  * Added an additional check for both the moved and deletion threshold
    being exceeded at the same time to make the email output and subject
    more specific.

  * Added number of equal files found to printouts where the array is
    checked for changes by "snapraid diff".

  * Minor other improvements to code and printouts.

snapraid-daily (1.3.2-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Refined new check for errors on sync and scrub commands to directly
    consider the exit status and the number of io/data/file errors
    reported by snapraid.

  * Script should now handle unexpected events or interruptions to sync
    and scrub commands more gracefully.

  * New method re-gained ability to determine if the sync command is ran
    and doesn't find anything to sync. Although as before the check with
    snapraid diff will prevent sync being ran if there are no changes.

  * Added a printout of the error counts in the email along with the
    exit status.

 -- Mark Finnan <mfinnan101@gmail.com>  Mon, 26 May 2025 20:20:31 +0100

snapraid-daily (1.3.1-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Using the "-h" option means that it is no longer good enough to
    just look for "Everything OK" in the output of the sync operation.

  * Switched to looking at the summary messages within the sync output
    log instead. The script will now report if there are File Errors,
    I/O Errors or Data Errors to give a better more descriptive output.

  * This unfortunately looses the ability to specifically detect if the
    sync command runs and finds nothing to sync, but by default the
    check for changes should ensure that sync is not called if there
    are no changes, so this probably doesn't matter.

  * Added similar checking of the scrub command log for scrub operations,
    the same granularity should now be reported if the scrub operation
    does not run successfully.

    default.

  * Added ability to disable emails on success through an option in

  * Added "-h" option to snapraid sync to serve as another safeguard
    against errors.

  * Updated manpage to mention the above and also the check for the lockfile
    added in version 1.1.0

snapraid-daily (1.0.9-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Switched to using mktemp to create logfiles.

  * Bundled an elementary config file into the default location, so
    the script should run out of the box with default settings.

  * Syntax improvements in manpages.

 -- Mark Finnan <mfinnan101@gmail.com>  Wed, 14 Nov 2024 10:15:19 +0100

snapraid-daily (1.0.8-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Changed to a while loop in the parse_arguments function, as found
    this to be a more reliable way of looping through the arguments than
    the for loop that was previously being used.

  * Added the ability to override the default config by the usage of
    an argument to the script. (-f or --config) This is mainly intended for
    the case where one might have multiple snapraid arrays on the same
    system.

  * Streamlined the picking of the config file using an if-elif-else statement,
    instead of the messy nested if that was used previously.

  * Also changed the order of preference to look for the config file to
    the below. Previously the sample config file in the docs folder was
    looked for directly after the default location.
    1: Custom Config supplied via -f or --config
    2: /etc/snapraid-daily.conf
    3: Same Directory as script
    4: /usr/share/doc/snapraid-daily/sample-config/snapraid-daily.conf

  * Minor improvements to output messages to make them more readable.

  * Added sample systemd drop-in files and some notes about using them in
    the docs directory.

  * Updated the manual pages to reflect the ability to specify a custom
    config file, and mention the included systemd drop-in files.

snapraid-daily (1.0.7-1) stable; urgency=medium

    a valid output to systemctl is-active to correctly stop a service 
    if it is currently running upon running apt purge or apt remove.

snapraid-daily (1.0.6-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Added template systemd timer and service files into the package,
    to be installed to /etc/systemd/system but these are not enabled
    by default.

  * Updated manpages and documentation to reflect this and encourage
    the user to use overrides through systemctl edit.

  * Added a postinst script to detect a 1st time installation and
    reload systemd (may prompt the user for a user and group name to
    run snapraid-daily here on future releases)

  * Added a prerm script to check if the timers/services are either
    active or enabled and stop/disable them accordingly followed by
    a reload of systemd.

snapraid-daily (1.0.5-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Script would exit if mutt was not installed. Changed functionality
    to run to the end but disable emails if mutt is not installed.
    This is the expected behaviour as mutt is recommended instead
    of a standard dependency.

  * Removed version and date from manual pages so changing them is no
    longer necessary for new revisions.

    exceeded.

  * Added dependencies to debian package.
  
  * Changed the script to run in the complete absense of the config file

    vast majority of users.

  * Note that the emails are disabled in this case.

  * Added a -h, --help argument to print out a quick help message.

 -- Mark Finnan <mfinnan101@gmail.com>  Sun, 06 Oct 2024 15:17:06 +0100

snapraid-daily (0.9.1-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed an issue where the script would not continue after detecting the
    right amount of tries in the file that records the number of failed
    syncs due to the thresholds being exceed in certain conditions.

  * Reduced deletion of log files to 30 days old.
 
 -- Mark Finnan <mfinnan101@gmail.com>  Sun, 22 Jan 2023 19:47:43 +0100

snapraid-daily (0.9.0-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Added the ability to set a number of tries before forcing a sync in the
    config file. This way a sync will be forced after the thresholds have
    been found to be exceeded after a certain number of times.

  * This removes the need of the user to have to interact with the system
    in this case. However this does assume the files deleted/moved are
    not important.

  * Re-structred parts of the script to operate out of its own directory,
    for example /opt/snapraid-daily/.

  * Added systemd unit files a .timer file and a .service file for a
    standalone sync job, a standalone scrub job or a combined default
    of sync, then scrub.

snapraid-daily (0.8.1-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Added a check for --scrub-only and --sync-only being specified at the
    same time - the script will now exit if this is done.

  * Added a warning printout if one specifies --override-thresholds while
    --scrub-only is active to mention the former has no effect in this
    case.

  * Fixed a problem in the if-elif-else statement in the function that
    determines the arguments.

 -- Mark Finnan <mfinnan101@gmail.com>  Sun, 09 Oct 2022 17:11:34 +0100

snapraid-daily (0.8.0-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Combined snapraid-sync and snapraid-scrub scripts into one master
    script.

  * By default the script will now do a check on the initial status
    via "snapraid status", then move on to running touch if required.

  * After that the script will run sync, finally followed by scrub.
  
  * Added the ability to pass arguments to the script: --scrub-only,
    --sync-only and --override-thresholds.

  * This allows one to run sync only or run scrub only which is useful
    if somebody wants to seperate the sync and scrub operations.

  * The script will now attach the command log if an error was detected.
  
  * This allows the user to know the issue by just looking at the
    notification emails alone.

  * Changed subject of notification email to "SnapRAID-Scrub" or 
    "SnapRAID-Sync" from "SnapRAID-Daily" if sync-only or
    scrub-only arguments are being used.
