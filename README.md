# snapraid-daily
Bash Script for the automation of all essential SnapRAID functions with
in-built email notifications and monitoring of the number of deletions/moves.

# Description
Thank you for your interest in this script. Snapraid is very good software,
but lacks any default automation or notification ability.

That is where this script comes in, it is intended to be an all-in-one
script for the automation of snapraid.

There are many other scripts out there that essentially do the same thing,
and are probably better than this one. However, none of them had exactly
the features the author wanted or were more complex than desired.

This led to this script being created by the author. It has worked quite well
for the author up to this date, and hopefully prove useful to others.

All possible scenarios were attempted to be covered. It was decided to keep
the approach simple, and only to focus on snapraid operations and simple
email notifications rather than adding many different features.

It is intended to be ran as a scheduled task via cronjob or systemd timers
(some examples are provided in the docs - see near the end of this manual
entry\), but can also easily be ran manually if need be.

If errors are detected, the user is notified by email and the script will
exit. Note that no attempts are made here to automate the correction of
errors automatically, the user will have to intervene in each case if they
are detected.

Before attempting to use this script, one should ensure that snapraid is
normally functioning. That is one can run the following commands without
any error being encountered. See the snapraid documentation.

1. **snapraid status**   
2. **snapraid sync**   
3. **snapraid scrub**   

The broad goal here is to be an all-in-one script to automate the necessary
snapraid functions that can be scheduled accordingly.

While the script will run out of the box with the default config, for best
operation, a config file is required.

The location for the config file **(snapraid-daily.conf)** is tried in the
following order of preference:

1. **Via the -f or \--config option if specified**    
2. **/etc/snapraid-daily.conf**    
3. **snapraid-daily.conf** in the script directory    

If the config file is not found in any of the above locations, the defaults
will be used. Note that this will disable the email functionality.

The contents of **snapraid-daily.conf** should contain the following and the
syntax should be correct as per bash. The script will again exit if errors
are present in this file. A sample is provided here in the docs folder.

1. MuttRC File Path for Notification Emails    
2. Email Address for Notification Emails    
3. Deletion Threshold    
4. Move Threshold    
5. Scrub Percentage     
6. Scrub Age     

The number of files deleted and moved are monitored and if either exceed
the threshold values specified in **snapraid-daily.conf**, the script will
exit and notify the user via email.

The idea here is that if a large number of accidental moves or deletions
are detected, it is probably an accident, and a sync would be a bad idea
as it will prevent the recovery of those files.

If errors are detected, the script will notify the user via email and attach
the logfile generated by snapraid itself, so the user can quickly see what the
problem is from the email notification alone.

By default if no arguments are invoked the script will execute the following
functions in the below order. This will accomplish everything and is
sufficient to run once a day or however often is desired.

This can also be tweaked by the supported arguments to the script if one wants
to sync the array only or scrub the array only.

Order of Operations is:

1. Check for Inital Errors    
2. Run Touch (If Required)    
3. Sync the array (If Changes are Present)    
4. Scrub the array

# Usage
```bash
Usage: snapraid-daily         [OPTIONS...]

  -s, --sync-only             Only Sync the Array - Do not run Scrub
  -c, --scrub-only            Only Scrub the Array - Do not run Sync
                              Note that if both of these options are omitted, the
                              default is to run sync and then scrub. They also can
                              not be specified at the same time
  -o, --override-thresholds   Ignore the deletion/moved thresholds to force a sync
  -f, --config [path-to-conf] Override default config file. Could be useful if one
                              has multiple snapraid arrays to manage on the same system
  -q, --quiet                 Suppress the output of the touch, diff, sync and scrub
                              commands for snapraid. The final status message is still
                              displayed as normal.
  -h, --help                  Print help

Manual Entries:
  Main Script:                snapraid-daily(1)      $ man snapraid-daily
  Config File:                snapraid-daily.conf(1) $ man snapraid-daily.conf
```

## Examples:

To only perform sync:  
```bash
snapraid-daily -s
```

To only perform sync and override thresholds:     
```bash
snapraid-daily -s -o
```

To only perform scrub, do:     
```bash
snapraid-daily -c
```

To override the config file to **/path/to/user.conf** do:     
```bash
snapraid-daily -f /path/to/user.conf
```

If an invalid argument is specified, the script will exit.

# Installation
To install the package do:

```bash
sudo apt install ./snapraid-daily_1.2.6-5_amd64.deb
```

This will install the dependencies automatically.

Alternatively to install manually, download the script
and make it executable.

```bash
chmod +x snapraid-daily
```

Next ensure all dependencies are installed:

* grep,awk,sed,mktemp,cut - Available on pretty much every linux based system
* SnapRAID

Then create the config file as discussed below, an example is provided
here in the docs folder.

# Config File (snapraid-daily.conf)
Main configuration file for the snapraid-daily script.

To be placed in either:

* **/etc/snapraid-daily.conf**    
* Same directory as the main script    

If installed via the debian package, a sample configuration
file is already placed at the 1st location above that can be
edited by the user.

Overriding the default config file can also be accomplished by
using the **-f, \--config [PATH-TO-CONFIG]** as an input argument
to the script.

The package installation will also place a sample file in the docs
location below.    
**/usr/share/doc/snapraid-daily/sample-configs/snapraid-daily.conf**

This can be used as a template to generate the
optimum config file in the default location:    
**/etc/snapraid-daily.conf**

Finally if the script cannot find any configuration file it will
continue with the defaults (See below **CONTENTS** section)

## Config File Contents

The main parameters included in the file are:

* **snapraid_config_file_path**    
* **muttrc_path**    
* **email_address**    
* **deletion_threshold**    
* **moved_threshold**    
* **scrub_percent**    
* **scrub_age**    

If any of the above are missing, defaults are loaded,
see below:

### snapraid\_config\_file\_path

This is the path to the main config file defining the array
for snapraid itself. It is usually **/etc/snapraid.conf**
but in the event that it is at a different location, it
can be specified here. The default is **/etc/snapraid.conf**

This is useful for the situation where the user may be running
multiple SnapRAID arrays on the same system.

### muttrc\_path

This is the path for the muttrc file that is used for sending
email notifications. No emails are sent if this is omitted.
The default is empty, whereby no emails are sent.

See the example here to set up the email notifications:    
**/usr/share/doc/snapraid-daily/muttrc-sample/muttrc**

### email\_address

Main email address to send the notification emails to. The
default is none, thus disabling email notifications.

### deletion\_threshold

If the number of files deleted since the last sync is
found to be greater than this number, then the script
will exit and notify the user via email. Must be a postive
number. The default is **100**

### moved\_threshold

As above, but for files moved. Must be a positive number.
The default is **100**

### scrub\_percent

The percentage of the array to scrub. The default is **8%**

### scrub\_age

The age of files in days to scrub. The default is **21 days**

# Sample File Contents (snapraid-daily.conf)

Shown below is the bare minimum that is required in
a snapraid-daily.conf config file. Feel free to add
comments using **\#** accordingly.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Snapraid Config Path
snapraid_config_file_path="/etc/snapraid.conf"    

# Email Notification Parameters
# Muttrc File and Email Address
muttrc_path="/opt/email_notifications/mutt/muttrc"   
email_address="server@example.com"  

# Deletion and Moved Thresholds
deletion_threshold=200* 
moved_threshold=200

# Scrub Age and Percent
scrub_percent=10  
scrub_age=7
```

# Setting up Email Notifications

A valid muttrc configuration is required to send email notifications.
A sample that works for Gmail can be found here. It should be simple to
adapt to another email provider also.    

# Automation with Systemd

By default the following systemd files are bundled with the package
installation, but are not enabled by default. If installing manually the
unit files can be found in the docs folder here.

* **/etc/systemd/system/snapraid-daily.service**    
* **/etc/systemd/system/snapraid-daily.timer**    
* **/etc/systemd/system/snapraid-sync.service**    
* **/etc/systemd/system/snapraid-sync.timer**    
* **/etc/systemd/system/snapraid-scrub.service**    
* **/etc/systemd/system/snapraid-scrub.timer**    

1. **snapraid-daily** does a sync,then a scrub (the default).    
2. **snapraid-sync** syncs the array only.    
3. **snapraid-scrub** scrubs the array only.    

This is intended to cover the case where the user wishes to automate
the **sync** and **scrub** operations together, or run them seperately.

To enable any one of the timers do: 
```bash
systemctl enable snapraid-daily.timer
```

It is not recommended to edit any of the service files directly. It is
instead better to create drop-in files by using:    
```bash
systemctl edit snapraid-daily.service
```

Although to get the expected results with the timer files, it might be
necessary to edit them directly.

Some further examples are provided in the docs directory for both the
main service/timer file and also drop-in files that can be generated
(see below).    
**/usr/share/doc/snapraid-daily/systemd-examples/**

Note that some examples are also provided in the docs for using **cron**
to run the script.

## Running as a Non-Root User via Systemd

Note that by default all of the above service files will run as root.
This is probably fine for most users, however if one wants to run
snapraid as a different user other than root, some further configuration
is required, namely:

* Create a directory **/etc/systemd/snapraid-.service.d/**    
* Create a file called **user.conf**, or (anything**.conf**)    
* Put the following into that file and place it in the above directory    

```bash
[Service]  
User=username   
Group=groupname
```

Where **username** and **groupname** are the user and group names of the
user one wants to run snapraid, and thus **snapraid-daily** as.

The naming of the **/etc/systemd/system/snapraid-.service.d/** directory
will cause it to be picked up by all of the systemd service unit files
installed by the script, or any services  with a name of the structure:     
**snapraid-\[something\].service**

Lastly, reload systemd:     
```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
```

Further example drop-in files and unit files for systemd and some
notes are included here:

* **/usr/share/doc/snapraid-daily/systemd-drop-ins/**     
* **/usr/share/doc/snapraid-daily/systemd-examples/**     

# Return Codes

The Script Returns the following codes for the following conditions.
This can be useful to direct systemd or a seperate master script to
carry out further actions depending on the code. It is planned to add
further return codes the future.

* 0: Success    
* 1: All Errors    
* 2: SnapRAID already in use    
* 3: Files Modified During Sync    
* 5: Thresholds Exceeded
