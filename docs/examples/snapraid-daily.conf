# use the default of 21 days.
scrub_age=21

###################################################
# Extra Options (All Disabled by Default)
###################################################
# Disable emails and the custom notification hook on
# successful runs, error emails/notifications are unaffected
# and still sent as normal. Uncomment and set to yes to use.
# Emails and calls to the notification hooks are always done
# by default, unless this option is used.
#disable_emails_on_success="no"

# Force Sync on Zero File Size (NOT Recommended)
# If a file is found to have zero size that previously
# didn't force a sync. Uncomment and set to "yes" to
# use. NOTE: NOT Recommended
#force_zero="no"

# Force Sync on Empty (NOT Recommended)
# If one or more of the disks are found to be empty,
# force a sync. Uncomment and set to "yes" to use.
# NOTE: NOT Recommended
#force_empty="no"

# Force Sync on UUID Change (NOT Recommended)
# If the UUID of one or more of the disks is found to
# change, force a sync. Uncomment and set to "yes" to
# use. NOTE: NOT Recommended
#force_uuid="no"

# Specify an alternative path the the SnapRAID Binary
# if required - The vast majority of users should not
# require this. Uncomment to use.
# Otherwise if not used, the output of the "which snapraid"
# command is used as a path to the SnapRAID binary by default.
#snapraid_binary_path="/alternative/path/to/snapraid/binary"

# Disable the check for an update. The script will check if curl
# is installed, and if so will check the Github page to see if a new
# updated version is available by default. If an updated version is
# found, it will print out a note saying so at the start and also add
# a line to the email also. Comment out and set to yes if you wish
# to disable this feature.
#disable_update_check="no"

# Get SnapRAID to generate its SMART report and add it to the email.
# This calls "snapraid smart" and records its output in the email
# notification that is sent. This either requires the script to be
# ran as root or for sudo to be set up to call snapraid smart as a 
# non-root user. See the Github README or the snapraid-daily.conf(1) manual
# entry for more information about sudo. Note that no analysis of the output
# is done, it is just included. Comment out and set to yes to
# enable this feature. Off by default.
#smart_report="no"

# Get SnapRAID to spin down all Hard Disks after the script has
# completed all operations. As above, this requires the script to
# be ran as root or for sudo to be set up to call "snapraid down"
# as a non-root user. As before, see the Github README or the
# snapraid-daily.conf(1) manual entry for more information about sudo.
# Comment out and set to "yes" to enable this feature. Off by default.
#spin_down_disks="no"

###################################################
# Start & End Hooks (Optional)
###################################################
# Path to custom hook scripts that are called throughout a run.
# Must be executable. Comment out if not using.
#
# Start-Hooks: Called after initial checks have completed. Called
# with a "start" argument. Example:
# $ /path/to/start/hook start
# The main script will exit with an error if the start hook returns
# an error (non-zero) code.
#
# End-Hooks: After the script has finished all tasks
# or if the script exits with an error. Called with an
# "end" argument. Example:
# $ /path/to/end/hook end
# Unlike the start hook, the main script does not end with an error
# if this hook reports an error and will continue to end.
#
# The use of the arguments "start" and "end" allow the same hook script
# to be used for both functions. If any variables are required for
# either hook script, they
# can be specifed below with with the use of "export"
#
# Note that these do not have to be bash scripts per se, they can
# be anything that can be ran from the command line. They don't have
# to use the "start" or "end" arguments. They also can be totally seperate
# scripts.
#
# See the SnapRAID-DAILY-Hooks Repository here for some hooks that can
# be used to expand functionality along with instructions on how to set
# them up
# https://github.com/zoot101/snapraid-daily-hooks
#
# Up to 5 are supported. To use them specify start_hook1/end_hook1 to
# start_hook5/end_hook5 below depending on how many you want to use.
# See the sample config in the docs folder here:
# /usr/share/doc/snapraid-daily/examples/snapraid-daily.conf (or on github)
# https://github.com/zoot101/snapraid-daily/blob/main/docs/examples/snapraid-daily.conf
#
# Use the services hook from the SnapRAID-DAILY-Hooks package here:
# https://github.com/zoot101/snapraid-daily-hooks and have it stop
# and later restart smbd (Samba), sonarr, radarr, lidarr, readarr and bazarr
start_hook1="/usr/bin/snapraid-daily-service-hook"
end_hook1="/usr/bin/snapraid-daily-service-hook"
export service1="smbd"
export service2="sonarr"
export service3="radarr"
export service4="lidarr"
export service5="readarr"
export service6="bazarr"

# Use the commands hook from the SnapRAID-DAILY-Hooks package here:
# https://github.com/zoot101/snapraid-daily-hooks and have it mount
# the parity disk when the script starts and unmount it when it
# finishes. (Assumes there is a single parity disk mounted at
# /mnt/parity_disk1)
start_hook2="/usr/bin/snapraid-daily-commands-hook"
end_hook2="/usr/bin/snapraid-daily-commands-hook"
export start_command1="sudo mount /mnt/parity_disk1"
export end_command1="sudo umount /mnt/parity_disk1"

###################################################
# Notification Hook (Optional)
###################################################
# Path to custom notification hooks if one wishes to use
# an alternative form of notification than standard emails, or
# in addition to the standard email functionality. Up to 5
# are supported.
#
# The hook script is called like so:
# /path/to/hook "Email-Subject" "Email-Body" "Email-Attachment"
#
# The attachment is only included if an error was encountered.
# Leave commented out if not using.
# 
# See the SnapRAID-DAILY-Hooks repository here for some notification
# hooks and instructions on how to set them up.
# https://github.com/zoot101/snapraid-daily-hooks
#
# To use them specify the variables notification_hook1 to
# notification_hook5 depending on how many you want to use,
# (start at 1). See the sample config in the docs folder here:
# /usr/share/doc/snapraid-daily/examples/snapraid-daily.conf (or on github)
# https://github.com/zoot101/snapraid-daily/blob/main/docs/examples/snapraid-daily.conf
#
# Use Apprise Hook and Healthchecks.io hook from SnapRAID-DAILY-Hooks
# package here: https://github.com/zoot101/snapraid-daily-hooks
notification_hook1="/usr/bin/snapraid-daily-apprise-hook"
export apprise_url1="ntfys://channel_name_here"
export apprise_url2="tgram://bot-id/chat-id"
export apprise_url3="mailto://username:password@gmail.com?to=email-destination@example.org"

export healthchecks_sync_url="https://hc-ping.com/123...456...789"
export healthchecks_scrub_url="https://hc-ping.comf/12a3...456...789a"
export healthchecks_url="https://hc-ping.com/abc...def...ghi"

###################################################
# Hook Script Variables 
###################################################
# If any of the hook scripts require variables to be passed
# into them this can be done here. This is more elegant
# than having seperate config files for hook scripts etc.
# (Make sure not to forget the export)
# export var1="whatever"
# export var2="variable-here"
# etc.
