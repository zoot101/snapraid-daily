# Mutt Notes

The script will work just fine without any email functionality,
but in the opinion of the author it isn't much use without it.

The author has used **mutt** for many years with success
to send emails. The script requires a muttrc file which will
contain all the settings to allow mutt to send emails.

# Sample Configuration

A sample configuration here is provided that works with **Gmail**
which should be easy enough to set up with other providers
also.

Note that 2FA is required to be enabled in your Gmail account,
one will then have the option to create app passwords which
can be specified directly in the **muttrc** file.
